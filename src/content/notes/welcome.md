## What to expect

If you're here, you might find posts about:

- **Single-cell genomics**: Thoughts on methods, analysis approaches, and where the field is heading
- **Research life**: The realities of running a lab, mentoring trainees, and navigating academia
- **Science communication**: How we talk about complex research to different audiences
- **Tools and workflows**: Software, coding practices, and productivity approaches that work for me

Thanks for reading.
